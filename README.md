# BigsonDev - Knowledge Pills

# Welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi there, great you seek knowledge.

Knowledge Pills are helpful code examples & theory to help you progress as a Frontend Developer.
They are e.g. JavaScript/HTML/CSS/React snippets of solutions and answers you might need when implementing your projects.

# Projects

When it comes to projects, you can check out the [Library](https://bigsondev.com/library/) on my website as it's a newly announced section, where you can work on real-world coding assignments.

# Support

**I'm doing my best to fill this repository with a lot of pills. üíä**

You can support me by visiting [BigsonDev](https://bigsondev.com) website and doing some activities, e.g. reading a blog, grabbing mentoring from me, or just having fun solving code challenges.

If you have any ideas on which Knowledge Pills should I work next, feel free to reach out to me.
